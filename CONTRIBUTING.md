# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! From typos, to sample code, tutorials and beyond, we truly appreciate and welcome input from everyone.

## Git process

This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). We are happy to have issues opened for discussion, but we don't require an issue to be created before a pull request is opened. When you have a change you want us to consider:

* Create a new branch on your own fork, from an up-to-date master branch.
* Make the changes on that new branch.
* Open a pull request for us, making sure to tell us what you changed and why in the pull request title and description.  Pull requests without a meaningful title and a completed template may be closed.

If you need more information about how to do any of the above, we recommend the [GitHub Help pages](https://help.github.com/), which are indeed very helpful.

Tips:

* Keep it small! Small changes are easy to review and more likely to be accepted. More involved changes probably need discussion first.
* Tell us _what_ changed and _why_. This helps us to understand the change and get the right people to review it.
